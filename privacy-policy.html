    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="tagline">ExpiryOne — All Your Expiries, All in One Place.</div>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Add Date]</p>

    <p>
      ExpiryOne (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the ExpiryOne mobile application (the “App”).
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      ExpiryOne does not require account creation and does not collect personally identifiable information
      such as your name, email address, phone number, or address.

    <h3>b. App Data (Stored Locally)</h3>
    <p>The App may store the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expiry dates (food, medicines, documents, subscriptions, etc.)</li>
      <li>Item names, notes, and categories</li>
      <li>Reminder and notification preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data stays on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
    </p>

    <h3>c. Notifications</h3>
    <p>
      ExpiryOne uses local notifications to remind you of upcoming expirations.
      Notification data is processed only on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>
      All app data is stored locally on your device. We take reasonable measures to protect your information,
      but no method of electronic storage is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      ExpiryOne may use third-party services such as analytics or crash reporting tools to improve app quality.
      These services may collect anonymous, non-personal data according to their own privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples may include Google Play Services, Firebase Analytics, or Apple Analytics.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Permissions Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send expiry reminders</li>
      <li><strong>Storage (optional):</strong> For backup or export features, if enabled</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
